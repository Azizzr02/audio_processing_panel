# Audio Processing Suite

## Description
The Audio Processing Suite is a Python application that integrates multiple audio processing functionalities, including:

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Convert text into spoken words using a simple interface.
- **Audio Recording**: Record audio from your microphone with easy-to-use controls.
- **Audio Classification**: Classify audio files based on trained models to recognize different sounds or music genres.
- **Audio Filtering and Equalizer**: Apply real-time audio filtering and equalization to enhance sound quality.

This project is ideal for developers, musicians, and anyone interested in audio processing.

## Features
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.
- Support for various audio formats.
- Adjustable equalizer settings to manipulate audio frequencies.
- Real-time audio playback and filtering.
- Text-to-speech functionality using popular libraries.
